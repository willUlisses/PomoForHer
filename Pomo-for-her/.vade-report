# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Pomo-for-her project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.3.1) to the project dependencies
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json accordingly

### 2. Modified Files
**src/App.tsx**
- Added import for `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to the main app render (placed after the Timer component)

### 3. Implementation Details
Since this is a React + Vite project, I followed the documentation for React apps:
- Used the `/react` import path from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Placed the component in the main App component to ensure it's loaded on all pages
- The component is a wrapper around the tracking script that seamlessly integrates with React

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ Dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ package-lock.json updated with new dependencies

## Next Steps for Deployment
To start collecting Speed Insights data, the project owner should:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the updated app to Vercel (which will add the `/_vercel/speed-insights/*` routes)
3. After deployment with user visits, data will appear in the Speed Insights dashboard

## Notes
- Pre-existing linting warnings in Timer.tsx component are unrelated to this implementation
- The SpeedInsights component will only collect data when deployed on Vercel
- No configuration is needed; the component works out-of-the-box with Vercel's infrastructure
